lob,20, An introduction,1,"<p style=""text-align:center""><img alt="""" src=""img/scaleLogo.png"" style=""height:64px; width:64px"" /></p><p>SCALE is an interactive platform for delivering adaptive instruction online. It works with standard learning management systems (LMS) to provide an instructional framework that guides the learner through the instructional content based on proven theories about how people learn effectively.</p><p>The LMS&nbsp;has become a staple in all instructional environments and provides a valuable function in storing content, making it accessible to learners, and interacting with class rosters and grade books. But there is a big difference between simply delivering instructional content and actually teaching it. This is precisely the gap that SCALE fills. It provides a highly interactive user experience that uses proven adaptive learning techniques to provide instruction that can rival the gold standard of instruction: one-on-one personal tutoring.</p><p>SCALE is open source and freely available for any academic or&nbsp;non-commercial use.</p>"
lob,30,How It Works,20,"<p style=""text-align:center""><a href=""do(GOTO +1)""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1828/41453196810_5c7cbcf6ce_m_d.jpg"" style=""height:130px; width:200px"" /></a></p><p>The instructor identifies existing instructional elements and organizes them into a course. These resources can include videos, audio, images, documents, simulations, and highly interactive web applications. The instructor uses SCALE&rsquo;s easy authoring tool to create a learning experience that weaves these diverse instructional resources into compelling instructional content for the learner.</p><p>The instructor easily creates a simple outline that shows the relationships between the content items, and their most effective order. SCALE uses that relationship mapping to provide resources to the learner in an adaptive, interactive, &rdquo;just-in-time&rdquo; manner that takes advantage of today&rsquo;s web,enabled world.</p>"
lob,301,Adaptive Learning,30,"<p style=""text-align:center""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1830/41453196980_5bd2ef3e8a_m_d.jpg"" style=""height:96px; width:240px"" /></p><p>SCALE uses adaptive learning techniques to guide learners individually through instructional content by assessing and continually adjusting their learning path to walk that fine line between what they do and do not yet understand.</p><p>All learners come to instruction with some pre-existing knowledge about the topic being taught. They are initially assessed and a model of that knowledge is created. SCALE then compares that idealization of what the learner knows with the content map to guide them through the most appropriate content elements to learn next.</p>"
lob,302,Interactive Interface,30,"<p style=""text-align:center""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1789/43262976371_4f45979b3d_m_d.jpg"" style=""width:100px"" /></p><p>SCALE uses a highly interactive user interface that makes it easy for learners to work with the instructional content. The instructor creates learning&nbsp;<em>panes</em>, with different content in each. Each pane can include a wide range of web-based resources, including images, video, and audio, text documents, websites, web-apps, graphical data visualizations, and 3D simulations.</p><p>The learning path determines what the student sees next&nbsp;by clicking the green &ldquo;next&rdquo; button. This path is updated constantly to reflect what the student knows, so already-encountered resources are flagged as seen (<span style=""color:#27ae60"">green</span>), and requisite ones are presented in the appropriate order.</p>"

Instead of building monolithic software systems the exhibit the &ldquo;Jack of all trades, master of none&rdquo; mentality, it is now possible to seamlessly weave a collection of smaller, finely-targeted parts together.</p><p><strong>Modern technology base -&nbsp;</strong>SCALE is a state of the art HTML5-based web-application that runs on all devices, from smartphones to desktops. It requires no plug-ins to be downloaded to accommodate the typical locked-down school environment. It is an open platform that uses a standardized messaging system to support instant communication between the elements in the various panes and allows for easy addition of new pane types without extensive programming.</p><p><strong>Extensible </strong>- SCALE is easily extended to do things that are specific to your needs. We use a messaging system that allows external modules on other servers communicate with SCALE and control the learning path.

The whole learning process is mediated by a learning path that suggests what should be learned next&nbsp;based on what the student knows and what the instructor wants them to know. This map is constantly being updated by the student&rsquo;s progress through the materials and the outcomes of any assessments taken.</p><p>Our basic process is modeled from the structure of <strong>Intelligent Tutoring Systems</strong>, developed over the past 30 years and proved to be highly effective at getting results that rival person one-one tutoring efforts. These systems were good at teaching very structured subjects like algebra but were less effective in typical disciplines. We have taken a more modern, and looser approach which should prove more effective in a wider variety of subjects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left:80px"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-left:80px"">&nbsp;</p>"

At its simplest, a pane can be a bit of HTML-text, to more interactive options such as videos, Qmedia video experiences, digital simulations, web-pages, and traditional assessment tools. These smaller blocks are combined using the learning paths that guide the student through the material in a meaningful fashion and are stored in a Google Docs document for easy real-time sharing and editing.</p><p>There are two important things to understand about learning objects: They are modern HTML5 pages capable of calling upon the rich world of available web objects and secondly, they can actively communicate with those web objects to control their actions, and/or retrieve student actions to guide further instruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Videos can&nbsp;start and stop at particular times, contain graphical overlays, subtitles, and have assessment embedded within them.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maps</strong> - Highly interactive maps with historic images and maps embedded in them, along with popups and markers are easily added. The SHIVA tools (<a href=""http://www.viseyes.org/shiva"" target=""_blank"">www.viseyes.org/shiva</a>) provide easy ways to create this maps.

This can trigger things like setting the learning path or showing particular learning panes when actions, such as clicks and assessment answers are completed. A learning path object can have any number of rules assigned to it, and they are stored in the Google Doc.</p><p>Rules take the form of a declarative sentence: If this happens, do that. The three parts are set as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>If this</strong> - This defines the action to be on the lookout for. This can be if the learner clicks on a learning object, answers an assessment question, clicks on a graph, clicks on a map, moves the video to a time, or clicks on an area of an image. You can also look at a variable that combines many sub-options to trigger more complex events. It is reported to the happens phase as a number or a word, indicating the action&rsquo;s value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Happens </strong>- Some indication of the degree in which the action occurred so you can trigger something when a threshold has been reached. Possible options are if the action equals, a number or word, is less than and larger or is similar to the threshold.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do that</strong> - The action you want to trigger if the value crosses the happens threshold. This has the student go to the next or last learning pane, a specific pane. or set the status of an object so the learning path is altered You can also define a variable that can be used to trigger other rules.</p></li></ul>"

lob,605,Active Media Skins,60,"<p>Active Media Skins are overlays that can be attached to some media, typically a video, to provide an interactive layer to the content. The skins can be triggered to appear at specific times in the video. A skin can overlay graphics, provide buttons, and respond to clicks and drags by the learner. For example, &nbsp;we might want a video to play until 12 seconds, then overlay a message for the student to click on a specific item on the screen. If they clicked near the right area, some action, such as a message saying &ldquo;Good job!&rdquo;, or play some other portion of the video if not.</p><p>You can trigger actions if a learner clicks or hovers over a spot, or you can provide a graphic that they can drag around the video screen. In all three cases, you provide a position in the frame for the correct spot and how close they need to be.</p><p><strong>AMS Example 1 -</strong>&nbsp;Shows a video clip of visualization guru Hans Rosling. After&nbsp;a few seconds, a button appears to move&nbsp;us further in the video. After he explains a graph, you are asked to point our a spot in the frame. If you&nbsp;choose correctly you are led to another portion of the clip. Then you are asked to type something, and if you don&#39;t answer correctly, the video replays to tell you the answer. Finally, you drag a graphic somewhere&nbsp;to trigger the next pane.</p><p><strong>AMS Example 2 </strong>- A lesson graciously&nbsp;provided by <a href=""http://www.helpprogram.net"" target=""_blank"">Help Math</a>,&nbsp;with an interactive exercise skin atop a video. Students must drag images of animals in order of their weight. Dings happen when right or a whoosh sound when wrong.

tra,9000,Wallace transcript,,"00:01 The problem is I think post-modernism|00:03 has to a large extent run its course|00:05 David Foster Wallace is known for being|00:08 one of the most influential writers in|00:10 recent history before taking his own|00:12 life in 2008 he decried the negative|00:15 effects post-modernism had on his|00:17 generation post-modernism is a very|00:19 wide-ranging term used to analyze our|00:22 world that emerged in the 1950s and 60s|00:24 it rejected the grand narratives that|00:27 exist in modernism things like there is|00:29 one true god histories progress and|00:31 peace on earth in postmodern thought|00:33 there is no scientific philosophical or|00:36 religious truth which will explain|00:38 everything for everybody it lacks that|00:40 optimism instead everything is|00:42 understood on a micro level knowledge|00:45 and truth are contextual and constructed|00:47 reality only comes into existence|00:49 through our interpretations of what the|00:50 world means to us individually|00:52 thus post-modernism is characterized by|00:54 self-referentiality such as a character|00:57 who knows their character and a novel or|00:59 film by moral relativism and by cynicism|01:02 and irony with that in mind here's|01:05 Wallis again the problem though is now|01:07 is that a lot of the sticks of|01:09 post-modernism irony cynicism|01:11 irreverence are now part of whatever it|01:14 is that's enervating in the culture|01:16 itself right Wallace's biggest concern|01:18 was with the dominant cultural force of|01:20 television which he believed had become|01:22 too saturated with these postmodern|01:24 characteristics TV's response to dumb|01:27 and overly sentimental sitcoms was irony|01:30 TV shows began criticizing themselves|01:31 for being dumb TV shows this can't be|01:34 happening we have to see this movie dude|01:36 squared it probably isn't all that good|01:38 anyway hi man what are you talking about|01:39 you love Terrance and Phillip|01:41 yeah but animations are crabby it's hard|01:45 to criticize a show that criticizes|01:47 itself first shows became more self|01:49 referential and self-deprecating in|01:51 short they took nothing seriously and|01:53 there's a problem with this in Wallace's|01:56 mind irony has no redemptive qualities|01:59 in and of itself it can point out|02:01 problems and deconstruct things but it|02:03 offers no solution it's like a rebel to|02:06 throning a tyrant|02:07 only to become a better tyrant take for|02:10 example Seinfeld's ironic critique of|02:12 the sitcom every characters very human|02:14 problems are laid bare but they're|02:16 presented as unsolvable whereas earlier|02:19 more sugary sitcoms might offer a|02:21 solution through family friends or|02:23 hobbies Seinfeld gives you nothing|02:26 that's not a redeeming formula it's a|02:28 cynical one Family Guy’s use of irony is|02:31 slightly different but no more redeeming|02:33 it makes ironic connections to history|02:35 celebrity stereotypes you name it but it|02:37 cares more about the number of|02:39 connections that can make rather than|02:40 providing any lessons or challenging any|02:43 principles with them it simply uses|02:45 irony to reassure us of our knowledge of|02:47 cultural discourse|02:49 you've got Saturday Night Live's|02:50 deconstruction of cynicism Arrested|02:52 Development superficial relationships|02:54 it's always Sony's irredeemable|02:56 characters and in Wallace's time all of|02:59 these shows the ironic mode shows up in|03:01 advertising all the time here are twenty|03:03 ads making fun of themselves for being|03:05 ads hello I'm an actor I've been paid|03:08 $8,000 to tell you how great Norton it|03:11 is compared to other banks to Wallace|03:13 TVs unabashed self-deprecation and|03:16 deconstruction of our culture the idea|03:19 that everything is fabricated was|03:21 corrosive to the soul hip cynical|03:24 transcendence of sentiment is really|03:26 some kind of fear of being really human|03:29 he thought we'd find a solution in|03:31 shifting televisions overall tone away|03:33 from one of cynical irony to one of|03:36 sincerity and no doubt this tonal shift|03:38 is occurring in some spheres of pop|03:40 culture and has been for the last decade|03:42 it's due in part to David Foster Wallace|03:45 himself and likely to a general cultural|03:47 shift away from cynicism in general it's|03:50 interesting to see how this tonal shift|03:51 has affected TV comedies some of|03:53 comedies greatest tools are|03:55 characteristically postmodern so how|03:57 have these combined with sincerity to|03:59 change American humor it all starts in|04:02 2006 with the office then in 2009 the|04:05 tonal shift toward sincerity continued|04:07 with community Modern Family and Parks|04:10 and Recreation they all have|04:11 similarities to their postmodern|04:13 predecessors but instead of the blank|04:15 parody of family guide the|04:16 superficiality of arrest|04:18 development or the cynicism of Seinfeld|04:20 they have a heart they have redeeming|04:22 characters who have a sincere yearning|04:24 for meaning and human connection the|04:27 office is full of redemptive people|04:28 looking for human affirmation and the|04:31 irony in the show is balanced with|04:33 earnest sentimentality|04:34 take for example Jim and Pam's romantic|04:36 chemistry their connection relies on a|04:39 hyper awareness and mutual ironic|04:41 detachment from the office it's not just|04:43 irony for irony sake it has that|04:46 addition of a sincere human relationship|04:48 attached to it indeed rarely does this|04:50 show use irony at the expense of a|04:52 character ever in one episode a recently|04:54 dumped Andy tries to talk Jim out of|04:56 being with Pam and Jim responds to him|04:59 ironically so scary how right the things|05:02 are saying are and you're coming at it|05:05 with almost no knowledge of course I|05:07 trust your opinion on this|05:08 Andy reads Jim's ironic comment as|05:10 sincere and for the rest of the day|05:13 believes he's genuinely taking on all of|05:15 Jim's emotional troubles even though|05:17 Jim's perfectly happy with his|05:19 relationship at the end of the episode|05:21 one of Andy's co-workers reveals the|05:23 joke I think Jim is messing with you but|05:25 instead of judging or belittling Andy|05:28 for the postmodern crime of being naive|05:30 in the face of irony Jim uses the|05:33 occasion to teach Andy a sincere lesson|05:36 that stuff that happened with you and|05:37 Angela is a bummer and I know that you|05:39 don't think you're ever gonna find|05:40 someone else but you will I promise you|05:42 you will Jim's ironic stance ends with|05:45 in delivering a sentiment upholding|05:47 American romantic ideals much like the|05:50 office community balances its pop|05:52 cultural references and ironic moments|05:54 with characters who sincerely desire a|05:56 human connection the title of the show|05:58 tells us this outright it's about how|06:00 and why we come together and form|06:02 communities with other people and even|06:04 when it parodies and deconstructs TV|06:06 tropes like the jock it does so in an|06:08 uplifting way turning the all-star|06:11 quarterback into one of the most caring|06:13 people on the show and despite its|06:15 frequent cynicism community tells us|06:17 that no matter how isolated in a lone|06:19 you may think you are we need other|06:21 people around us in order to function it|06:23 doesn't matter if it's a bunch of|06:24 outcasts they can still come together|06:26 through their shared similarities and|06:28 the ways they conflict with each other|06:30 as well the show at its core believes in|06:33 common human dignity and communal|06:35 integrity it's a sincere anti nihilistic|06:38 message you won't get from these shows|06:40 then there's Parks and Recreation which|06:43 contains very few postmodern|06:45 characteristics you won't find the show|06:46 making fun of itself|06:48 there's no meta humor it avoids a|06:50 cynical tone entirely ultimately it's a|06:52 show about good people trying to do good|06:55 things|06:55 Leslie Knope and Ron Swanson have an|06:57 entirely different idea of civic duty|06:59 you have the hope and naiveté of|07:01 government embodied in Leslie and the|07:04 pessimism and deconstruction of|07:06 government embodied in Ron|07:07 this relationship is ripe for a sort of|07:09 Seinfeld II and resentment and cynicism|07:11 but Ron and Leslie have a mutual respect|07:14 for each other and they have a good|07:15 friendship both are awesome both are|07:17 flawed and the show constantly goes back|07:19 and forth between them without taking|07:21 aside Andy and April are very similar|07:23 both are great but one is ultra-sincere|07:26 and the other cynical we see every|07:28 characters ideology but never fully|07:29 embrace or discredit their stance sure|07:32 the show is about bureaucratic conflict|07:34 but it's also about how disparate people|07:36 in a town connect the show's overall|07:39 tone that cynical thinking isn't the|07:41 smartest or coolest makes a dramatic|07:43 shift away from post-modernism this wave|07:46 of earnestness and TV comedy shows no|07:48 sign of slowing down|07:49 part of the reason Jon Stewart was|07:51 successful for so long was that he had|07:53 an unwavering sincerity behind the irony|07:55 in the daily show two of his major|07:57 successors understand that balance the|08:00 best shows of our age aren't finding the|08:02 humor and the gaps that have developed|08:03 between people they find the humor in|08:06 the absurd and awkward attempts by|08:08 people trying to bridge those gaps they|08:10 want to show us that humans can have|08:12 real connections and sincerity for each|08:14 other it's not impossible it's just|08:17 really fucking hard postmodern thought|08:19 with its deconstruction of everything|08:21 and its emphasis on individual|08:23 interpretation leads us down a road of|08:25 narcissism cynicism and detachment to|08:28 fix it we need not appeal to something|08:30 as abstract or dangerous as the grand|08:32 narratives of modernism to feel less|08:35 lonely it's perhaps this non-ideological|08:37 pursuit of getting|08:39 long of striving to have strong communal|08:41 integrity valuing others for their human|08:44 dignity unabashedly enjoying the things|08:46 we find to be awesome|08:48 and as David Foster Wallace would say|08:50 making it okay to be unavoidably|08:52 sentimental and naive and gue prone and|08:55 generally pathetic that might help us|08:57 find a greater sense of meaning and|08:59 optimism in our lives these shows tell|09:02 us that strict adherence to cynicism|09:04 isn't all that smart or cool and that|09:06 perhaps we learn more about what it|09:08 means to be human by embracing life and|09:11 the different people around us everyone|09:16 thank you so much for watching I had an|09:18 absolute blast making that video I don't|09:21 always make videos like that I like to|09:23 make comedy content as well
